NOTE: This URL may be part of a "bouncer phishing" campaign, which relies o=

a preset email list of targeted recipients. For the purposes of this=20
notification the email address of the targeted recipient which would be
contained within the URL has been removed, and may result in the phishing
site rendering a fake "404" error page. Phishing campaigns of this nature

within its "bouncer list" is contained within the URL, thereby making it
difficult to ascertain whether the phishing site is live or down. We urge
you to fully interrogate the web service associated with this URL for the=20
purposes of identifing it as a phishing site.

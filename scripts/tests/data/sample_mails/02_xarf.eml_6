Hello Abuse-Team,

your Server/Customer with the IP: *37.24.158.163* has attacked one of our servers/partners.
The attackers used the method/service: *imap*  on: *Fri, 14 Feb 2014 20:57:25 +0100*.
The time listed is from the server-time of the Blocklist-user who submitted the report.
The attack was reported to the Blocklist.de-System on: *Fri, 14 Feb 2014 20:57:32 +0100*

The IP has been automatically blocked for a period of time. For an IP to be blocked, it needs 
to have made several failed logins (ssh, imap....), tried to log in for an "invalid user", or have
triggered several 5xx-Error-Codes (eg. Blacklist on email...), all during a short period of time.
The Server-Owner configures the number of failed attempts, and the time period they have 
to occur in, in order to trigger a ban and report. Blocklist has no control over these settings.


Please check the machine behind the IP 37.24.158.163 (aftr-37-24-158-163.unity-media.net) and fix the problem.
To search for AS-Number/IPs that you control, to see if any others have been infected/blocked, please go to:

being sent again.

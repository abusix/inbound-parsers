Hello!
Have you recently noticed that I have e-mailed you from your account?
Yes, this simply means that I have total access to your device.

For the last couple of months, I have been watching you.
Still wondering how is that possible? Well, you have been infected with mal=
ware originating from an adult website that you visited. You may not be fam=
iliar with this, but I will try explaining it to you.

With help of the Trojan Virus, I have complete access to a PC or any other =
device.
This simply means I can see you at any time I wish to on your screen by sim=
ply turning on your camera and microphone, without you even noticing it. In=
 addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your corres=
pondence.

You may be asking yourself, "But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this=
 even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?" Well, the answer is=
 simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four =
hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.

I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen -=
 the video you were watching while masturbating.
Wondering how bad could this get? With just a single click of my mouse, thi=
s video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.
I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers th=
at you use.

All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins wo=
rth $1490 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, =
you can open your browser and simply search: "Buy Bitcoin").

My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1Q7oKyU8HWEZk2RhP9AapqdnuCy9p3TUAq

After receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video rig=
ht away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.
You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.
Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will=
 start ticking.

Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this e-m=
ail cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.
I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any =
chance for a mistake.=20

If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody=
 else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.

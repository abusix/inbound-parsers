To whom it may concern,

173.255.191.13 is reported to you for performing unwanted activities toward our server(s).

=============================================================================
Current records of unwanted activities toward our server(s) on file;
the second field designates our server that received the unwanted connection;
if this is a webserver log, the [VirtualHost] designates the visited website.

=============================================================================
Notes:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Unsolicited connections to well-known ports (e.g. FTP, SSH, Telnet, and others), and attempted database queries/injections/extractions are considered especially toxic; associated IP addresses are blacklisted on sight.
* Connections must have completed the three-way handshake before being logged and processed; spoofed connection attemtps are not logged and not blacklisted.
* Any line containing a "GET" or a "POST" request refers to an attempt to access, exploit, or test for, a vulnerability or an attack vector on one of our webservers. The most prevalent attempts are 'wp-login' and 'wp-admin', and Joomla/Drupal equivalents. We host zero WordPress/Joomla/Drupal installations. This is usually a sign of a computer that is itself infected with a trojan or other malware, and is looking to infect other machines. Note that these are attempted URLs on OUR webservers, not on a webserver at the reported IP address. Scan the server at the reported IP address for outdated WordPress installations, trojans, and other malware.
* Please do not ask us which "outbound domain" an attack came from, or which "website" instigated the attack: we cannot know this. We can only give you the connecting IP address, the connected IP address, extremely accurate timestamps, and source/destination port numbers. If this is not enough information for you, YOU will have to increase or improve your tracing and logging to mitigate future attacks.

Remarks:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Your e-mail address <abuse@strongtechnology.net> was retrieved (best-guessed) automatically from public WHOIS/RDAP data (e.g. https://www.whois.com/whois/173.255.191.13 and https://client.rdap.org/?type=ip&object=173.255.191.13) and other IP/domain-related information. If <abuse@strongtechnology.net> is not the correct e-mail address to report spam and security issues inside your network(s), please update your public WHOIS/RDAP data or ask your ISP or IP owner to do so.
* Please accept ALL email sent to your abuse address; we will never use a web form or any other reporting medium for this automated process. 
* We also blacklist (and expand blacklistings) based on mail flow analysis, netblock hygiene (the more hosts in a network are already blacklisted, the faster additional hosts in that network will be blacklisted), DNS/BGP/AS/RIR/LIR data, and third-party sources and reports. 
* We will send you no more than one report per week per IP address; this does not mean that the attacks do not continue during that week. The only exception to this is when we make the blacklisting permanent, because the attacks are too wide-spread and persistent.
* We will not help you solve your problem. Please talk to a professional systems administrator, and/or scan your system using up-to-date antivirus software, and/or talk to your ISP or hoster.
* The fully automated nature of this reporting process, and the fact that this type of activity takes place 24/7, means that there will be the occasional false positive. We apologize in advance. When we find those, we will report them to you and take measures to prevent them from reoccurring.
* You cannot reply to this e-mail directly. If you need to get in touch with us, the only point of contact is <abuse@abuse.espresso-gridpoint.net>.

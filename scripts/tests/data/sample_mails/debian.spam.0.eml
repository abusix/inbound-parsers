Hi,

I have been receiving dozens of nearly identical spam emails from IP
addresses in your 193.31.41.0/24 block over the past year, including two
in the past day. Please see the attached messages for their full
headers. I can provide more examples if required.

Best wishes,
Ryan Kavanagh

Hi Mr. Kavanagh,

The leading custom clothiers, Aman Tailors, is inviting you to experience the best of bespoke tailoring with our handcrafted suits, shirts, trousers, jackets, tuxedos and more. Tailor made for women of elegance and gentleman of style.

We are also doing other items such as custom Polo's, shorts, Khakis, jeans, belts and our special Friday Shirts with matching masks that take you straight from the board room to the bar room!

Please join Master Tailor Mr. Mirpuri in Pittsburgh on May 16th & 17th for a one-on-one consultation to create your very own custom piece. 

Even if you are unable to make it at this time, it would assist us greatly, particularly in these difficult times, if you could forward our email to at least a few of your friends or family - where ever they may be in the country is not an issue as we have a large reach - or you can even send us their information and we can get in touch with them directly.

We practice very safe social distancing measures, all appointments are in a private area and clients will be required to wear a mask and undergo temperature checks. Hand sanitizers & masks can also be provided.  

All items are fully customizable, from the fabric, lining, monograms, down to the buttons you want. Our tailor Mr. Mirpuri will guide you through the process. We are showcasing our extensive fabric line comprising of designer brands Loro Piana, Zegna, Dormeuil, Scabal and we will assist you in choosing the best material for your lifestyle.

Hello,

CERT.br is the Brazilian National Computer Emergency Response Team
responsible for handling computer security incidents related to networks
connected to the Brazilian Internet.

We have detected phishing scam emails that refer to a phishing page
hosted at:

  http://162.144.88.140/~bbacesso/Portal/%5BBancoBrasil%5D/g5s6df54v9sd8h7ha96d8h79fb4df9g8h7d6fv8h7s9dh7gs6d8h7b.html
# end logs

NOTICE: This site is only accessible by Brazilian IP addresses. You
        have to access the server's filesystem to see the phishing
        webpages.

This is a counterfeit website of a Brazilian institution and is
currently collecting sensitive data from its users.

We would like to ask you:

  * to help us cease this activity and shut down the phishing page;

  * if possible, according to your policies, if you can send us any
    logs or other information regarding the publication or access to
    this homepage; also, if in your investigations you figure out
    where the data collected is being sent to, that information could
    help us in our investigations.

Thanks in advance,

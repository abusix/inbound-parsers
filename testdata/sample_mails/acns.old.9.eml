Re: Unauthorized Use of CBS Property -- NCIS

Notice ID: 222122224633
Notice Date: 02-14-2016
Email: abuse@eastlink.ca

CBS and/or its affiliated companies are the exclusive owners of copyrigh=
ts or distribution rights in television programming, including "NCIS" "C=
BS Property".

You are receiving this notice because an IP address associated with an I=
nternet account assigned to EastLink, was identified as having been rece=
ntly used illegally to make and/or distribute copies of CBS Property ide=
ntified at the bottom of this letter. Such content theft is a serious of=
fense that carries the risk of substantial monetary damages and, in some=
 cases, criminal prosecution. Although various legal and equitable remed=
ies may be available to CBS as a result of such infringement, the entire=
 Internet community can benefit when these matters are resolved cooperat=
ively. We ask that you forward this notice to the subscriber who was ass=
igned the applicable Internet connection at the time of the action (as d=
ocumented below), and to take appropriate steps to deter future infringe=
ment, including:

(1) Require the subscriber to remove or delete all unauthorized copies o=
f CBS Property;=20
(2) Ensure the account is no longer used to copy or distribute CBS Prope=
rty in the future;=20
(3) Require the subscriber to confirm the above steps have been taken; a=
nd
(4) Take appropriate action against the subscriber under your Abuse Poli=
cy/Terms of Service.

The information included at the end of this notice specifies details of =
the infringement, including location, and can help you and the subscribe=
r prevent serious legal and other consequences of content theft.=20

CBS believes that subscribers have a right to know when their Internet a=
ccounts are being used for content theft, or if they are otherwise unwit=
tingly downloading or distributing files that are subject to copyright p=
rotection, because that illegal activity could expose them to legal liab=
ility and other consequences under the Terms of Service (TOS), Acceptabl=
e Use Policy (AUP) or other policies of their ISP. Online content theft =
can also expose a family's home network and the computers connected to i=
t to dangerous viruses, spyware and identity theft. Peer to Peer (P2P) a=
pplications are particularly risky because they can make accessible to o=
ther P2P users all of the information on a consumer's computer, includin=
g a consumer's bank and credit card account numbers, tax returns, or sen=
sitive health information. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has iss=
ued a consumer alert on the risks of P2P file sharing: http://www.ftc.go=
v/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt128.shtm. The FTC website OnGuardOnlin=
e.gov also provides consumer protection information on computer security=
, including securing wireless networks: http://onguardonline.gov/topics/=
secure-your-computer.

We appreciate your efforts to reduce copyright infringement on your netw=
orks. Please send us a prompt response indicating the actions you have t=
aken to resolve this matter. Please reference the above noted Notice ID =
222122224633 in all correspondence, which should be directed to:

Email: Cbs.antipiracy@ap.markmonitor.com

The undersigned has a good faith belief that use of CBS Property in the =
manner described herein is not authorized by CBS, its agents or the law.=
 We hereby state that the information in this notification is accurate a=
nd, under penalty of perjury, that the undersigned is authorized to act =
on behalf of CBS with respect to this matter.

Please be advised that this letter is not and is not intended to be a co=
mplete statement of the facts or law as they may pertain to this matter =
or of (CBS's) positions, rights or remedies, legal or equitable, all of =
which are expressly reserved.=20

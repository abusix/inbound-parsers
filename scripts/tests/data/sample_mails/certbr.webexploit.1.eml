You are receiving this message because you are listed as the contact
for the networks below.

This message is intended for the person responsible for computer
security at your site.  If this is not the correct address, please
forward this message to the appropriate party.

Our logs show that malicious attempts, targeting well-known webserver
vulnerabilities, were made from your network against servers in our
domain.  This is definitely not an authorized request and we view it
as an attempt to compromise our network.

Either your machine has been compromised and is now being used to
launch hostile activity, or a legitimate user is engaged in activity
that is probably in violation of your terms of service agreement.  In
either case, please investigate this matter.

At the bottom of this message we have attached parts of our logs in
order to help you investigating.

We would appreciate a reply that this note has been received.

Thank you,

CERT.br

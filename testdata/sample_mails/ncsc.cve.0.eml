Beste NCSC-partner,

Vanuit onze geautomatiseerde bronverwerking is er een melding binnengekomen
over een (gecompromitteerd) systeem waartoe een kwaadwillende toegang zou kunnen
hebben. 

Er worden in deze scan meerdere kwetsbaarheden gescand. 

Citrix - Indien bij een systeem in de lijst de tag Citrix wordt vermeld, is 
er een malafide achterdeur geconstateerd op een Citrix systeem. 

Cisco IOS XE - Indien bij een systeem in de lijst de tag device-implant 
wordt vermeld, is er een malafide achterdeur geconstateerd op een IOS XE
systeem.

Websites - Alle overige tags, die niet hierboven zijn vermeld zijn
gecompromitteerde websites. De betreffende website zou onder andere gebruikt
kunnen worden voor het versturen van spam, het uitvoeren van DoS-aanvallen
of het doorsturen naar schadelijke software.

De scan controleert niet of dit daadwerkelijk het geval is.

Wij raden aan om nader onderzoek te doen of de systemen nog steeds 
gecompromitteerd zijn. Maak hierbij een afweging het systeem te isoleren,
opnieuw te installeren en te voorzien van de laatste beveiligingsupdates.
Daarnaast is het advies om nader onderzoek te doen of verder misbruik reeds
heeft plaatsgevonden. Probeer ook de oorzaak te achterhalen zodat u niet 
opnieuw slachtoffer wordt en verwijder (indien aanwezig) schadelijke bestanden.

De informatie is afkomstig van Shadowserver. Zie voor meer informatie:
https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/compromised-website-report/

In de bijlage staan alle gegevens zoals die door het NCSC zijn ontvangen.

Indien u nog vragen heeft naar aanleiding van deze melding, vernemen wij
dit graag.

** ENGLISH VERSION ** 

Dear NCSC-partner,

From a reliable source we have received a report about a (compromised)
system to which a malicious actor has access. The system in question
could be used, among other things, for sending spam, performing DoS attacks
or redirecting to malicious software.

There are multiple vulnerabilities scanned during this scan.

Citrix - If a system in the list has the tag Citrix, a malicious backdoor
has been placed on the Citrix system.

Cisco IOS XE - If a system in the list has the tag device-implant, a 
malicious backdoor was found on an IOS XE system.

We recommend to investigate if the systems are still compromised. Consider
isolating the system, reinstalling the system and applying the latest 
available security updates. We also recommend to investigate if any further
malicious activity has already taken place.

Websites - All other tags, not mentioned above are compromised websites.

We recommend checking whether the website in question is compromised. If
that is the case, it is advisable to find out the cause so that you do not
become a victim again and (if any) delete malicious files.

This information comes from Shadowserver. For more information see:
https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/compromised-website-report/

The email attachment contains the data as received by the NCSC.

If you have any questions in regards to this report, please let us know.
Met vriendelijke groet,

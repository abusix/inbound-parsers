n the United States. =20

If you are an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you have received this lette=
r because we have identified a user on your network reproducing and/or dist=
ributing an unauthorized copy of a copyrighted sound recording(s).  This le=
tter constitutes notice to you that this user may be liable for infringing =
activity occurring on your network.=20

If you are an Internet subscriber (user), you have received this letter bec=
ause your Internet account was used to illegally copy and/or distribute cop=
yrighted music over the Internet through a peer-to-peer application. =20

Reproducing and distributing copyrighted works on a peer-to-peer network, s=
uch as BitTorrent, without the permission of the copyright owner, has been =
determined by the United States Supreme Court to be illegal.  If you are ca=
ught engaging in this activity, you could be held liable.

To avoid legal consequences, you (if you are the user) should immediately d=
elete and disable access to the unauthorized music on your computer.  Learn=
 how at the "copyright infringement notices" section of the RIAA website, a=
vailable at https://www.riaa.com/resources-learning/copyright-notices/.  Th=
at section also contains practical information about:=20

  - how you were identified and why illegal downloading is not anonymous;
  - what next steps to take; and
  - where to get music online legally.

We encourage Internet subscribers to visit the website http://www.whymusicm=
atters.com/ which contains a guide to the many authorized music sites where=
 fans can go to listen to and/or purchase their favorite songs.  =20

We have attached below the details of the illegal file-sharing that was ide=
ntified on the account in question, including the time, date, and a represe=
ntative sampling of the music copied or distributed.  We assert that the in=
formation in this notice is accurate, based upon the data available to us. =
 We have a good faith belief that this activity is not authorized by the co=
pyright owner, its agent, or the law.  Under penalty of perjury, we submit =
that the RIAA is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies in mat=
ters involving the infringement of their sound recordings, including enforc=
ing their copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.  This letter do=
es not constitute a waiver of any of our members' rights, and all such righ=
ts are expressly reserved.

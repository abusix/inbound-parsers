The logs attached at the bottom of this message show information about
malicious code, hosted at your network, that has been used for
*identity theft*.

The URLs have been found in phishings/scams e-mails reported to
CERT.br.  These were online when we tested them (you can find more
information about phishings/scams and identity theft at the end of
this message).

We would like to ask you to:

  * remove the malicious code from your site

Also, please check if your machine has been compromised and is now
being used by intruders in malicious activities, or if a legitimate
user is engaged in activity that is probably in violation of your
terms of service agreement.  In either case, please investigate this
matter.

You received this message because you are listed as the contact
for the networks below.  This message is intended for the person
responsible for computer security at your site.  If this is not the
correct address, please forward this message to the appropriate party.

If more than one IP at your site is hosting malicious code or if we
detect a new malware at your site, you will receive more than one
message, each one with different contents.

We would appreciate a reply that this note has been received.

Thank you,

======================================================================

* What is CERT.br?

  CERT.br is the Brazilian National Computer Emergency Response Team
  responsible for handling computer security incidents related to
  networks connected to the Brazilian Internet.

* What are phishings/scams?

  Phishing attacks use both social engineering and technical
  subterfuge to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial
  account credentials.  Social-engineering schemes use 'spoofed'
  e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick
  recipients into divulging financial data such as credit card
  numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers.
  Hijacking brand names of banks, e-retailers and credit card
  companies, phishers often convince recipients to respond.  Technical
  subterfuge schemes plant crimeware onto PCs to steal credentials
  directly, often using Trojan keylogger spyware.
  Source: Anti-Phishing Working Group.

  Phishings targetting CERT.br constituency usually lure the
  recipients to download malicious code from the URLs present in the
  spoofed e-mail.

* Where can I find information about phishings/scams?

* What is identity theft?

  Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personally identifying
  information, like your name, Social Security number, or credit card
  number, without your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes.

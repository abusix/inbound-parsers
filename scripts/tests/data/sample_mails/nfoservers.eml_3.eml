It appears that a public "chargen" service on your network, running on IP a=
ddress 69.40.247.199, participated in a large-scale attack against a custom=
er of ours, generating large UDP responses to spoofed probes that claimed t=
o be from the attack target.

chargen is an old testing service that generates large quantities of traffi=
c with only a small request required. It is commonly enabled by default on =
old printers and other connected appliances, but it has no useful purpose o=
ver the open internet.

Please block UDP port 19 (inbound and outbound) at your network edge, as th=
is should stop these chargen attacks without blocking legitimate traffic. I=
f the endpoint device that generated this traffic is configurable, please f=
urther investigate whether it is running a chargen service (and disable it,=
 if so) -- commonly exploited devices include Cisco hardware that has "udp =
small servers" mistakenly enabled, old printers, old UNIX boxes with "charg=
en" running under inetd, and Windows boxes with the "Simple TCP/IP services=
" package installed. Also, it is worth checking if it is a machine that has=
 been compromised, as some malware directly generates port 19 traffic, simu=
lating chargen, and in this way masks its presence.

If you are an ISP, please also look at your network configuration and make =
sure that you do not allow spoofed traffic (that pretends to be from extern=
al IP addresses) to leave the network. Hosts that allow spoofed traffic mak=
e possible this type of attack.

Example responses from your host during this attack are given below.=20

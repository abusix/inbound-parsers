<p>Somebody from your domain with an IP Address of <b>103.209.252.10</b> has been
attempting to break into my domain, <b>DeFaria.com</b>. <u>Breaking into somebody
else's computer is illegal and criminal prosecution can result!</u> As a
responsible ISP it is in your best interests to investigate such activity and to
shutdown any such illegal activity as it is a violation of law and most likely a
violation of your user level agreement. It is expected that you will investigate
this and send the result and/or disposition of your investigation back to
Andrew@DeFaria.com. <font color=red><b>If you fail to do so then criminal prosecution may
result!</b></font></p>

<p>Please be aware that <b>none</b> of these attempts to breakin have been
successful - this system is configured such that only trusted users are allowed
to log in as they must provide authenticated keys in advance. So your attempts
have been wholly unsuccessful. Still, this does not diminish the illegality nor
the ability of us to pursue this matter in a court of law.</p>

<p>There were a total of 74 attempts to break into DeFaria.com. The following
is a report of the breakin attempts from IP Address 103.209.252.10 along with the usernames
attempted and the time of the attempt:</p>

<p>Note: DeFaria.com is located in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. All times are UTC-7:</p>

Dear Madam, Dear Sir,

The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH (hereafter: the FH), based at 6, Rue d'Argent, CH-2501 Bienne (Switzerland) is the main organisation for the sector, with approximately 500 member companies, representing 90% of Swiss watch producers. Based on general and ad hoc mandates, the Federation has the authority to take action in order to defend the rights of its members.

It has come to the FH's attention that your company is leasing server space for an illegal website located at http://www.luxurywatches.is (confirmed by WHOIS records). The operator of this website is infringing our members' trademarks (more precisely: Audemars Piguet; Breitling; Hublot; Omega; Patek Philippe; Richard Mille; Tag Heuer, among other infringed trademarks) and according to our information and belief, is selling counterfeit products using said trademark(s). Unlawful use of the mark(s) occurs throughout the website, including unauthorised use of protected trademark(s) to promote sales of look-a-like and/or counterfeit watches.

All our members have registered trademarks worldwide, including in Switzerland, the European Union (community and national trademarks), the USA, the Russian Federation, Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, Turkey, etc.

Please note that, prior to notifying your company, the FH has been trying to communicate directly with the content provider. This attempt has unfortunately been unsuccessful, due either to the impossibility of identifying the content provider (in the WHOIS database and/or in the website's content) or the lack of a proper answer.

Your company is undoubtedly aware that the sale and promotion of counterfeits, either offline or online, infringes the owners' intellectual property rights. Conversely, it is possible that you were unaware of this issue, so the FH believes that it is in our mutual interest to bring this matter to your attention.

Notice of takedown
Domain name: luxurywatches.is 
Main URL: http://www.luxurywatches.is
IP address: 104.18.37.85, 172.67.205.4, 104.18.36.85 
Trademark(s) infringed : Audemars Piguet; Breitling; Hublot; Omega; Patek Philippe; Richard Mille; Tag Heuer
Latest investigation : 2021-01-01 

The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH requests that your company remove or disable access to the website in order to avoid any liability issues.

Accordingly, we request that you:
1. Block the DNS service for these domains;
2. Retain any and all documents and records relating to this matter, including but not limited to electronic data and other information which may be relevant/discoverable in the event of litigation. 

Please note that:
- The FH is an agent authorised to act on behalf of the owner of certain intellectual property rights (the "IP Owner") (trademarks, design and patent rights);
- The FH believes in good faith that the website reported above offers items or contains materials that are not authorised by the IP Owner, its agent or the law and therefore infringe the IP Owner's rights, and that the foregoing is true and correct;
- The use of the marks (such as Audemars Piguet; Breitling; Hublot; Omega; Patek Philippe; Richard Mille; Tag Heuer, etc.) claimed to be infringing said rights is not defensible.

This letter is sent without prejudice to our member's rights and claims, all of which are expressly reserved.

The FH may be contacted at:

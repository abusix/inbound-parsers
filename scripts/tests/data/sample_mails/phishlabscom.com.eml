Hello,

My name is Charles McLemore and I work for PhishLabs. We investigate comput=
er crime incidents on behalf of other organizations.

During an investigation of fraud, we have identified a phishing site which =
is hosted on your network and attempting to defraud the customers of Apple.

The following URLs are some components of this phishing attack:

hXXp go [dot] appleid [dot] appl [dot] wets [dot] myapleid [dot] woa [dot] =
wa [dot] directt [dot] myappleid [dot] woa [dot] 25napplic2faccount [dot] 2=

hXXp go [dot] appleid [dot] appl [dot] wets [dot] myapleid [dot] woa [dot] =

First detection of malicious activity: 11-17-2016 08:34:49 UTC
Most recent observation of malicious activity: 11-17-2016 08:54:00 UTC
Associated IP Address: 40.137.68.229
Hostname of Server: jazzrostlouis.com

If you agree that this is malicious, we kindly request that you take steps =
to have the content removed as soon as possible. It is likely that the intr=
uder who set up this phishing site has also left additional fraudulent mate=
rial on this server.

If we have contacted you in error, or if there is a better way for us to re=
port this incident, please let us know so that we may continue our investig=
ation.

We are extremely grateful for your assistance.

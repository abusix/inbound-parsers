An example could be downloading or sharing unauthorized copies of movies, songs or television shows using a peer-to-peer file sharing program like BitTorrent.

CenturyLink reminds you that copyright infringement is a serious matter that violates U.S. copyright law as well as CenturyLinkâ€™s Acceptable Use Policy and Terms of Service governing your account.  Continued violations may result in service restrictions up to and including service termination.  If you or someone using your internet connection is engaged in the conduct alleged by the copyright owner, we urge you to take action immediately.

    Notice Date: 09-21-2021
    
    
    Sir or Madam:
    
    I am contacting you on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the trade association whose member music companies create, manufacture, and/or distribute approximately 85% of all legitimate music sold in the United States.  
    
    If you are an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you have received this letter because we have identified a user on your network reproducing and/or distributing an unauthorized copy of a copyrighted sound recording(s).  This letter constitutes notice to you that this user may be liable for infringing activity occurring on your network. 
    
    If you are an Internet subscriber (user), you have received this letter because your Internet account was used to illegally copy and/or distribute copyrighted music over the Internet through a peer-to-peer application.  
    
    Reproducing and distributing copyrighted works on a peer-to-peer network, such as BitTorrent, without the permission of the copyright owner, has been determined by the United States Supreme Court to be illegal.  If you are caught engaging in this activity, you could be held liable.
    
    To avoid legal consequences, you (if you are the user) should immediately delete and disable access to the unauthorized music on your computer.  Learn how at the "copyright infringement notices" section of the RIAA website, available at https://www.riaa.com/resources-learning/copyright-notices/.  That section also contains practical information about: 
    
      - how you were identified and why illegal downloading is not anonymous;
      - what next steps to take; and
      - where to get music online legally.
    
    We encourage Internet subscribers to visit the website http://www.whymusicmatters.com/ which contains a guide to the many authorized music sites where fans can go to listen to and/or purchase their favorite songs.   
    
    We have attached below the details of the illegal file-sharing that was identified on the account in question, including the time, date, and a representative sampling of the music copied or distributed.  We assert that the information in this notice is accurate, based upon the data available to us.  We have a good faith belief that this activity is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  Under penalty of perjury, we submit that the RIAA is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies in matters involving the infringement of their sound recordings, including enforcing their copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.  This letter does not constitute a waiver of any of our members' rights, and all such rights are expressly reserved.
    
    If you have questions about this notice or need guidance on how to resolve this matter, feel free to contact us at (800) 656-1768 or send an email to the address listed below.  If you are able to identify and resolve the problem yourself, please send us a response indicating the actions you have taken.

    Notice ID: 222200612601
    Notice Date: 09-21-2021
    
    
    Sir or Madam:
    
    I am contacting you on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the trade association whose member music companies create, manufacture, and/or distribute approximately 85% of all legitimate music sold in the United States.  
    
    If you are an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you have received this letter because we have identified a user on your network reproducing and/or distributing an unauthorized copy of a copyrighted sound recording(s).  This letter constitutes notice to you that this user may be liable for infringing activity occurring on your network. 
    
    If you are an Internet subscriber (user), you have received this letter because your Internet account was used to illegally copy and/or distribute copyrighted music over the Internet through a peer-to-peer application.  
    
    Reproducing and distributing copyrighted works on a peer-to-peer network, such as BitTorrent, without the permission of the copyright owner, has been determined by the United States Supreme Court to be illegal.  If you are caught engaging in this activity, you could be held liable.
    
    To avoid legal consequences, you (if you are the user) should immediately delete and disable access to the unauthorized music on your computer.  Learn how at the "copyright infringement notices" section of the RIAA website, available at https://www.riaa.com/resources-learning/copyright-notices/.  That section also contains practical information about: 
    
      - how you were identified and why illegal downloading is not anonymous;
      - what next steps to take; and
      - where to get music online legally.
    
    We encourage Internet subscribers to visit the website http://www.whymusicmatters.com/ which contains a guide to the many authorized music sites where fans can go to listen to and/or purchase their favorite songs.   
    
    We have attached below the details of the illegal file-sharing that was identified on the account in question, including the time, date, and a representative sampling of the music copied or distributed.  We assert that the information in this notice is accurate, based upon the data available to us.  We have a good faith belief that this activity is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  Under penalty of perjury, we submit that the RIAA is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies in matters involving the infringement of their sound recordings, including enforcing their copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.  This letter does not constitute a waiver of any of our members' rights, and all such rights are expressly reserved.
    
    If you have questions about this notice or need guidance on how to resolve this matter, feel free to contact us at (800) 656-1768 or send an email to the address listed below.  If you are able to identify and resolve the problem yourself, please send us a response indicating the actions you have taken.  Please reference the above noted Notice ID 222200612601 in all correspondence, which should be directed to:
    
    Email: riaa.info@ap.opsecsecurity.com
    
    
    Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
    
    Sincerely,
    Bill Birnie,

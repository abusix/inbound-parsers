Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

das Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) ist ein Protokoll zur
zentralen =C3=9Cberwachung und Steuerung von Netzwerkger=C3=A4ten.

In den letzten Monaten wurden Systeme, welche SNMP-Anfragen aus dem
Internet beantworten, zunehmend zur Durchf=C3=BChrung von DDoS-Reflection-
Angriffen gegen IT-Systeme Dritter missbraucht.

Nachfolgend senden wir Ihnen eine Liste betroffener Systeme in Ihrem
Netzbereich. Der Zeitstempel (Zeitzone UTC) gibt an, wann der offene
SNMP-Server identifiziert wurde.

Wir m=C3=B6chten Sie bitten, den Sachverhalt zu pr=C3=BCfen und Ma=C3=9Fnahme=
n zur
Absicherung der SNMP-Dienste auf den betroffenen Systemen zu ergreifen
bzw. Ihre Kunden entsprechend zu informieren.

Falls Sie k=C3=BCrzlich bereits Gegenma=C3=9Fnahmen getroffen haben und diese
Benachrichtigung erneut erhalten, beachten Sie bitten den angegebenen
Zeitstempel. Wurde die Gegenma=C3=9Fnahme erfolgreich umgesetzt, sollten
Sie keine Benachrichtigung mit einem Zeitstempel nach der Umsetzung
mehr erhalten.

Weitere Informationen zu dieser Benachrichtigung, Hinweise zur
Behebung gemeldeter Sicherheitsprobleme sowie Antworten auf h=C3=A4ufig
gestellte Fragen finden Sie unter:
<https://reports.cert-bund.de/>

Diese E-Mail ist mittels PGP digital signiert.
Informationen zu dem verwendeten Schl=C3=BCssel finden Sie unter:

Dies ist eine automatisch generierte Nachricht. Antworten an die
Absenderadresse <reports@reports.cert-bund.de> werden NICHT gelesen
und automatisch verworfen. Bei R=C3=BCckfragen wenden Sie sich bitte
unter Beibehaltung der Ticketnummer [CB-Report#...] in der

Dear Sir or Madam,

the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network protocol
for monitoring and management of network devices.

Over the past months, systems responding to SNMP requests from
anywhere on the Internet have been increasingly abused for DDoS
reflection attacks against third parties.

Please find below senden a list of affected systems hosted on your network.
The timestamp (timezone UTC) indicates when the openly accessible
SNMP server was identified.

We would like to ask you to check this issue and take appropriate
steps to secure the SNMP services on the affected systems or
notify your customers accordingly.

If you have recently solved the issue but received this notification
again, please note the timestamp included below. You should not
receive any further notifications with timestamps after the issue
has been solved.

Additional information on this notification, advice on how to fix
reported issues and answers to frequently asked questions:
<https://reports.cert-bund.de/en/>

This message is digitally signed using PGP.
Information on the signature key is available at:
<https://reports.cert-bund.de/en/digital-signature>

Please note:
This is an automatically generated message. Replies to the
sender address <reports@reports.cert-bund.de> will NOT be read
but silently be discarded. In case of questions, please contact
<certbund@bsi.bund.de> and keep the ticket number [CB-Report#...]
of this message in the subject line.

!! Please make sure to consult our HOWTOs and FAQ available at
!! <https://reports.cert-bund.de/en/> first.

Mit der Umstellung auf ein neues Reporting-System erhalten Sie die Daten
zu betroffenen Systemen nicht mehr im Tabellenformat, sondern als CSV.
Bitte teilen Sie uns an <certbund@bsi.bund.de> mit, wenn Sie die Daten
als Dateianhang statt inline erhalten m=C3=B6chten.

With the switch to a new reporting system, you are now receiving data
on affected systems in CSV format instead of tabular form.
Please let us know at <certbund@bsi.bund.de> if you would like to
receive the data as a file attachment instead of inline.

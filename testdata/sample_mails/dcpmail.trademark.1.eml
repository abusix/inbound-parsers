reof, filed and granted in different countries worldwide.

In addition to the above, please be informed that Riello is the owner =
of several domain name registrations, including - but not limited to -=
 the following main ones: RIELLO.COM, .IT.=20

Thanks also to the above-cited trademarks and domain name registration=
s, Riello is definitely in the position to claim the exclusive right o=
n the =E2=80=9CRiello=E2=80=9D word and the right to prevent any third=
 parties from using =E2=80=9CRIELLO=E2=80=9D word as distinctive sign =
(such for instance as trade name, company name, domain name, shop sign=
, etc.) without authorization.

With great disappointment, we became aware of the fact that you either=
:

- granted registration/registered a domain name containing our Client=E2=

- are hosting a web site with a domain name containing our Client=E2=80=
=99s trademark =E2=80=9CRIELLO=E2=80=9D are hosting a web site that is=
 infringing Riello=E2=80=99s IP rights.=20

On the basis of all the former, considering that your act is a clear a=
nd blatant infringement of Riello=E2=80=99s IP rights, we are asking y=
ou to immediately:

In case you are the registrar:
- terminate the domain registration
- inform the site operator(s) of the illegality of his or her conduct

In case you are the registrant:
- cease any act of domains squatting and/or any commercial activity us=
ing Riello=E2=80=99s distinctive signs

In case you are the hosting provider:
- remove the infringing web sites/pages from your systems or disable a=
ccess to them
- inform the site operator(s) of the illegality of his or her conduct

We request you to comply with the above requests within seven (7) days=
 as of the receipt of this letter. In the lack of your reply, or shall=
 the same be negative, Riello will immediately take any appropriate ac=
tions in order to protect its IP rights.

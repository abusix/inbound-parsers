   Dear Sir/Madam,
 
 
 Please find below a copyright infringement notice sent to a site that is
making use of streaming servers hosted within your infrastructure. The RTMP
parameters for the stream are as follows, to enable you to trace the
specific machine within your infrastructure.

 We appreciate that the site itself may be hosted separately, and the
domain may no longer resolve to one of your IP addresses, however at the
time quoted we captured the stream from a stream server at the indicated IP
address and current best information resolves this address to yourselves.
 
 The stream above may not allow direct access to the video, however we have
observed the stream as playable when it is embedded into a page.
 This site is likely not hosted on your infrastructure, and the above URLs
more accurately reference the stream itself, however we are including this
page solely for convenience to be able to see the stream in question.

Work OR a substantial part of the Work is also reproduced.
 
 BT and/or its licensors do not permit any re-broadcasting or other
unauthorised distribution of the Work by any third party. Users are only
permitted to access the Works by paying the prescribed fee, or where BT has
expressly granted users the right to access the Works as part of wider
pre-paid services provided by BT.
 
 Your acts in respect of the Works are not authorised or permitted in any
circumstances.
 
 Additionally your use of the Works as described includes use of BT's
and/or its licensor's trade marks indicating that you are authorised by BT
or otherwise associated with BT. This amounts to passing off and/or unfair
competition, in light of the substantial goodwill and reputation that BT
has built up in providing services to the public.
 
 Statement of Authority
 
 The information contained within this notice is accurate, and I hereby
certify under penalty of perjury that I am authorised to act on behalf of
BT Plc of 81 Newgate Street, London EC1A 7AJ, the owner or exclusive
licensee of the copyright in the Works.
 
 I certify my good faith belief that the Offending Webpage has not been
authorised by BT, its licensors, its agents or the law (for example, under
any fair dealing exemption). Accordingly, these acts infringe BT's and/or
its licensor's copyright, contrary to applicable laws including in relation
to apparatus from which the Offending Webpage is transmitted, online
service providers and unauthorised reception or transmission of works
protected by copyright.
 
 Such acts will divert custom from BT and cause it serious loss.
 
 The Offending Webpage is operated by you. BT hereby gives you actual
knowledge of the above infringements of BT's and/or its licensor's rights,
under relevant copyright laws including, where applicable, within the
meaning of Article 14(1)(a) of the E-Commerce Directive (2000/31/EC).
 
 BT requests that you act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the
Offending Webpage.
 
 Please confirm within 10 Minutes of the communication of this letter that
you have removed or disabled access to the Offending Webpage. Your
confirmation should either be emailed to the following address:
operations@friendmts.com.
 
 If this confirmation is not received, BT reserves the right to issue legal
proceedings against you (which may be issued and served without further
notice to you), the remedies that may be available to BT include an
injunction pending trial, delivery up or (at our client's option)
destruction of all infringing copies, damages or an account of profits,
legal costs and interest.
 
 This is a complex area of law and I strongly recommend that you seek
independent legal advice immediately.
 
 All of BT's rights are reserved.
 
 Yours faithfully,
 
 
 Jonathan Friend

   Dear Sir/Madam,

 We act on behalf of Sky UK Limited (=E2=80=9Cour client=E2=80=9D). Our cli=
ent is one
of the leading providers of pay television and home entertainment services
in the UK and Ireland. It owns the exclusive rights in its broadcasts
(=E2=80=9CSky programming=E2=80=9D). It charges a prescribed fee to custome=
rs to view
the Sky programming, and it does not authorise any party to rebroadcast the
same by any means.

 Please find below a copyright infringement notice sent to a site that is
making use of streaming servers hosted within your infrastructure to
unlawfully broadcast Sky programming. The technical parameters that
uniquely identify the stream are as follows, to enable you to trace the
specific machine within your infrastructure.

 ip address: 138.68.129.221

 The stream above may not allow direct access to the video, however we have
observed the stream as playable when it is embedded into a page.
 This site is likely not hosted on your infrastructure, and the above URLs
more accurately reference the stream itself, however we are including this
page solely for convenience to be able to see the stream in question.

 As the copyright infringement notice makes clear, the operators of the
site referred to above are, amongst other things, infringing our client=E2=
=80=99s
copyright, and/or unlawfully using its trademarks. As the provider of the
service used to effect this unlawful activity, we request that you take
immediate steps to disable the site. A failure to do so will mean that any
defences you may otherwise have had under the E-Commerce Directive or
equivalent legislation will be lost, and you could be required to pay
damages and/or penalties for, amongst other things, infringement of
copyright in the works described below.

 Please confirm within 10 minutes by email to skymonitoring@friendmts.com,
retaining our Incident ID in the subject line, that you have complied with
the above. You may also respond by fax to +44 121 633 2001. Our client
expressly reserves its rights to pursue all available remedies and have
enforced all available penalties in the event of non-compliance by you with
this notice.

 Yours sincerely

 Dear Sir/Madam,

 We are writing to you on behalf of our client Sky UK Limited ("Sky").

 As you are no doubt aware, Sky is one of the leading providers of pay
television and home entertainment services in the UK and Ireland. Sky owns
the exclusive broadcasting rights in the Sky programming and it does not
authorise any party to rebroadcast its content by any means.

 Through our monitoring programme we have become aware that, on your
website 138.68.129.221, you have been making available to the public a
number of Sky broadcasts ("Sky programming"), found through the following
URL(s)/Channel(s):

 URL: http://138.68.129.221:8081/channels/streamcr7net2/playlist.m3u8
 Incident ID: 5993351
 Date seen (UTC): 2017-11-27 20:48:23

 As noted above, Sky owns the exclusive rights in its programming and users
access the Sky programming by way of paying the prescribed fee. The
re-broadcasting of any Sky programming is not permitted in any
circumstances.

 We hereby state that we have a good faith belief that the disputed use of
the copyrighted material is not authorised by the copyright owner, its
agent, or the law (e.g. as a fair use).

 We hereby state that the information in this Notice is accurate and, under
penalty of perjury, that our client is the owner, or authorised to act on
behalf of the owner, of the copyright or of an exclusive right under the
copyright that is allegedly infringed.

 Your actions are an infringement of our client's rights; in particular
they constitute copyright infringement under applicable legislation,
including that relating to apparatus used for unauthorised reception of
transmission or to online service providers.

 Our client takes infringement of its rights in this way very seriously.
This is a serious matter causing, or likely to cause, significant loss to
our client and our client therefore requires that you immediately cease all
such infringing and unlawful activity.

 Our client reserve all of their rights in this matter.

 Please confirm within 10 minutes by email to skymonitoring@friendmts.com,
retaining our Incident ID in the subject line, that you have complied with
the above. You may also respond by fax to +44 121 633 2001.

 Please remove the phishing components from your web server. We would
appreciate if you could share the collected information with us for warning
the victims. Patch all applications (content management systems, plugins and
alike) and server components (web server, ftp and alike) to the latest version
and review the security settings of all components.

 Please note: sometimes phishing sites redirect to legitimate sites. In this
automated processing of phishing, we cannot always avoid to notify owners of
legitimate sites and falsely inform them about their site being a phishing
site. Please contact info@circl.lu in a separate mail about your whish to
whitelist your domain.

 You can find a collection of best practices on our web site: https://
www.circl.lu/pub/tr-26/

 Don't hesitate to get back to us if you have further questions or need
additional support.

 We would appreciate if you confirm the reception of this report.

During an investigation of fraud, we discovered a compromised w=
ebsite (hXXp://69.55.54.199:8080/login.html) that is being used to attack o=
ur client and their customers.

In addition to the website owner, we ha=
ve addressed this report to the responsible authoritative providers who hav=
e the ability to disable the malicious content in question. Based on your r=
elationship to the content in question, please see our specific request bel=
ow.

If you agree that this is malicious, we kindly request tha=
t you take steps to have the content removed as soon as possible. It is hig=
hly likely that the intruder who set up this phishing content has also left=
 additional fraudulent material on this server such as illegitimate access =
points.

=3D=3D=3D WEBSITE OWNER =3D=3D=3D
We recommend taking the fo=
llowing actions to secure the web site and prevent the attackers from retur=
ning:
- Update your web applications including CMS, blog, ecommerce, and =
other applications (and all add-on modules/components/plugins).
- Search =
all of your web directories for suspicious files as attackers commonly leav=
e backdoors.
- Scan the computer from which you login to your web hosting=
 control panel or ftp server with anti-virus software.=20
- Change your web=
 hosting provider if this is an ongoing issue.

If your provider has di=
sabled your account because of this incident, you must coordinate a resolut=
ion with them directly as PhishLabs has no control over this aspect.

I=

ort this incident, please let us know so that we may continue our investiga=
tion.

We are grateful for your assistance.=20

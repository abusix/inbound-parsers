Dear Evisu Group Limited Ip Space:

We have just learned that your service is being used to facilitate fraud without your knowledge.

Recently, we have seen that a number of individuals have created false or "spoofed" PayPal.com web pages and emails, apparently in an effort to steal personal and financial information from consumers. When a PayPal user is fraudulently direct to such a spoof page, the user may input personal identification information into text fields on the spoof pages. Unfortunately, the perpetrators of such pages has chosen your service at 

119.9.75.174 - http://nitul.org/paypal/

as a means of re-directing that stolen identification information from the spoof site to the perpetrator's email account.

This matter is urgent - we believe that consumers have been falsely directed to this page and may be fooled into divulging personal information to a criminal if the page is not immediately disabled. We ask that you immediately disable your service from use on this site, so that this fraudulent scheme can be stopped.

In addition to the fact that this use of your service is illegal and harmful to consumers, you should take action to prevent it because the conduct violates those provisions of your user agreement that prohibit use of your product for unlawful activities or activities related to spam.

We sincerely appreciate your immediate attention to this important matter. We would also appreciate if you would take steps to confirm the accuracy of any contact information that your user may have provided to you in establishing the account. Should you have any accurate information that could assist PayPal and law enforcement in tracking this individual, we greatly appreciate your assistance, as we know that you do not condone the use of your services for such criminal purposes.

Regards,

PayPal Inc. 
Trust & Safety
ftsteam@paypal.com

Additionally, we invite you to help us and the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) in the fight against phishing with two important activities. First, please help us to educate consumers who are fooled by this criminal web site. You can do this by pointing the illegal URL to an educational page at: http://education.apwg.org/r/en?ORIGINAL_PHISH_URL&cobranding=497126 The instructions on how to implement it can be found here: ttp://education.apwg.org/r/how_to.html

Second, we would appreciate your participation in an anonymous survey looking into the ways phishers break into websites and servers to set-up phishing sites like this one.  The survey will take 10 minutes or so to complete, and we are hoping to share results with the webhosting, webmaster, and website owner communities to let you know how to better protect yourselves from such attacks in the future. The survey and instructions for completing it are here: http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229GLB7E43E

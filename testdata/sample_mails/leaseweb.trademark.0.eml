To whom it may concern,

On behalf of our clients SEVENFRIDAY AG, with its principal place of busine=
ss at Straffelstrasse 10, 8045 Zurich, Switzerland. I hereby inform you as =
follows.

SEVENFRIDAY is the exclusive owner of several trademarks, inter alia the SE=
VENFRIDAY, 7F, SEVENFRIDAY LOGO (the "SEVENFRIDAY Trademarks"). SEVENFRIDAY=
 has registered the SEVENFRIDAY Trademarks for numerous goods throughout th=
e world, including, but not limited to, watches, sun glasses (the "SEVENFRI=
DAY Properties"). For example, SEVENFRIDAY is holder of the following trade=
marks:

SEVENFRIDAY
WIPO Registration no. 13110044
Class. 15

No one is authorized to commercially use the SEVENFRIDAY Trademarks without=
 the express written permission of SEVENFRIDAY.

Recently it has come to my attention that the website cdn.replicahause.eu (=
hereinafter: "The Infringing Website=E2=80=9D) hosted on IP 23.111.9.35 con=
tains unauthorized use of the SEVENFRIDAY Trademarks. I have a good faith b=
elief that the use of SEVENFRIDAY Trademarks on replicahause.eu is not auth=
orized by SEVENFRIDAY, by any agent of SEVENFRIDAY, or by law. Such use con=
stitutes infringement on the SEVENFRIDAY Trademarks, as well as copyright i=
nfringement and unfair competition towards SEVENFRIDAY. SEVENFRIDAY conside=
rs such conduct to be a serious violation of its Intellectual Property Righ=
ts which causes damages to its business and reputation.
We have contacted the website owner, and gave him a reasonable time to resp=
ond to our request. The website owner did not reply to us, nor did he or sh=
e remove the infringing material.

The aforementioned infringements take place on the Infringing Website that =
is conducted under the below URL:
cdn.replicahause.eu
SEVENFRIDAY established that this website is hosted on your server with IP =
23.111.9.35. Therefore, SEVENFRIDAY demands that you - as hosting party of =
the Infringing Website - permanently remove The Infringing Website from you=
r servers or otherwise make the site permanently unavailable within 2 days.

This letter is not a complete statement of SEVENFRIDAY's rights in connecti=
on with this matter, and nothing contained herein constitutes an express or=
 implied waiver of any right, remedy, or defense in connection with this ma=
tter, all of which are expressly reserved.

The information in this notification is accurate, and I declare under penal=
ty of perjury, that I am authorized by SEVENFRIDAY to act on their behalf.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
On behalf of SEVENFRIDAY=20

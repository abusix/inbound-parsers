To Whom It May Concern:

We are writing on behalf of MoneyGram International, Inc. and its affiliate=
s (collectively, "MGI").  MGI has learned that you have registered our trad=
emark as an internet domain name: =20

 tomlhosting.co=20

MGI is a world renowned global payment services company with about 350,000 =
agent locations in 200 countries and territories.  MGI and its predecessors=
 have used "MoneyGram" as part of their trade name since 1988, and the Mone=
yGram=C2=AE brand is recognized throughout the world.  MGI owns trademark r=
egistrations for the MoneyGram mark around the world.

MGI has spent large sums of money and invested significant time and effort =
in advertising and promoting its products and services under the MoneyGram =
mark.  As a result, it has developed substantial public recognition and goo=
dwill in its mark.

Our federal trademark registration and date of first use of the MoneyGram n=
ame and mark precedes the date of registration of the  tomlhosting.co  doma=
in name by you.  Your registration and use of this domain name infringes th=
e intellectual property rights of MGI, may violate the U.S. Anti-Cybersquat=
ting Consumer Protection Act as well as other federal and international tra=
demark laws and is likely to mislead the public as to an affiliation betwee=
n you and MGI.  MGI believes that any use of the domain name in question wi=
ll cause confusion as to the source or origin of your company's services, o=
r mislead the public into believing that there is an association between yo=
ur company and MGI.

Accordingly, MGI hereby demands that you and your agents and affiliates imm=
ediately cease all use of domain name(s) listed above. This can be done by =
contacting the Registrar of the domain(s), and cancelling/deleting the regi=
stration. Once we can confirm the domain(s) has been dropped, we can consid=
er this case closed.

Unless you inform us by written reply to this email within fourteen (14) da=
ys stating you will comply with these demands, MGI intends to take all step=
s it deems necessary to enforce its trademark and other legal rights.

We view this as an extremely serious matter that requires prompt action by =
you.  MGI has a range of effective actions and other legal remedies availab=
le if you do not promptly comply.

This e-mail is being sent without prejudice to MGI's rights and claims, all=
 of which are expressly reserved.

Sincerely,
MoneyGram Legal Department

   Dear Sir/Madam,
 
 We act on behalf of Sky UK Limited (=E2=80=9Cour client=E2=80=9D). Our cli=
ent is one
of the leading providers of pay television and home entertainment services
in the UK and Ireland. It owns the exclusive rights in its broadcasts
(=E2=80=9CSky programming=E2=80=9D). It charges a prescribed fee to custome=
rs to view
the Sky programming, and it does not authorise any party to rebroadcast the
same by any means. 
 
 Please find below a copyright infringement notice sent to a site that is
making use of streaming servers hosted within your infrastructure to
unlawfully broadcast Sky programming. The technical parameters that
uniquely identify the stream are as follows, to enable you to trace the

 As the copyright infringement notice makes clear, the operators of the
site referred to above are, amongst other things, infringing our client=E2=

copyright, and/or unlawfully using its trademarks. As the provider of the
service used to effect this unlawful activity, we request that you take
immediate steps to disable the site. A failure to do so will mean that any
defences you may otherwise have had under the E-Commerce Directive or
equivalent legislation will be lost, and you could be required to pay
damages and/or penalties for, amongst other things, infringement of
copyright in the works described below. 
 
 Please confirm within 10 minutes by email to operations@friendmts.com,

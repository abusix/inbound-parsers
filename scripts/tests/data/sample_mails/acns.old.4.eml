Dear Sir or Madam:

TriStar Pictures, Inc. ("TPI") is the exclusive owner of copyright in th=

It has come to our attention that Unitymedia NRW GmbH is the service pro=
vider for the IP address listed below, from which unauthorized copying a=
nd distribution (downloading, uploading, file serving, file "swapping" o=
r other similar activities) of TPI 's property is taking place.  The doc=
umentation included at the end of this notice specifies the location of =
the infringement.  We believe that the Internet access of the user engag=
ing in this infringement is provided by Unitymedia NRW GmbH or a downstr=
eam service provider who purchases this connectivity from Unitymedia NRW=
 GmbH. =20

This unauthorized copying and distribution constitutes copyright infring=
ement under the Copyright Act, Title 17 U.S. Code Section 106(3)-(4).  D=
epending upon the type of service Unitymedia NRW GmbH is providing to th=
is IP address, it may have legal and/or equitable liability if it does n=
ot expeditiously remove or disable access to the property listed below, =
or if it fails to implement a policy that provides for termination of su=
bscribers who are repeat infringers (see, 17 U.S.C. 512).  This conduct =
may also violate the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and=
 Artistic Works and the Universal Copyright Convention, as well as bilat=
eral treaties with other countries that allow for protection of TPI's co=
pyrighted works even beyond U.S. borders.

Although various legal and equitable remedies may be available to TPI as=
 a result of such infringement, TPI believes that the entire Internet co=
mmunity benefits when these matters are resolved cooperatively.  We urge=
 you to take immediate action to effect removal of the detected infringe=
ment listed in the below report, including:

(1) Notify the account holder of this infringement
(2) Require the account holder remove the infringing material=20
(3) Disable access to the infringing material=20

ompt response indicating the actions you have taken to resolve this matt=
er.  Please reference the above noted Notice ID 22286017334 in all corre=

To whom it may concern,=20

Pursuant to Sony Network Entertainment International LLC ("SNEI") corporate=
 policy, the below IP addresses were blacklisted from using our services be=
cause SNEI detected activity that is abusive to our network services. In ou=
r determination, the abusive activity was not related to velocity or volume=
, but matched the specific patterns of known abuse of our publicly availabl=
e services. This abuse may be the result of a computer on your network that=
 has been compromised and is participating in a botnet abuse of our service=
s.

The following table of IP addresses, dates and times should help you correl=
ate the origin of the abusive activity.  The time stamps are approximate fr=
om our logs.  The actual timing of the events depend on the signature match=
ed.  It is very likely to have occurred both before, during and following t=
he times listed.

It is most likely the attack traffic is directed at one of the following en=
dpoints:

account.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com
auth.np.ac.playstation.net
auth.api.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com
auth.api.np.ac.playstation.net

These endpoints on our network are resolved by Geo DNS, so the IP addresses=
 they resolve to will depend on the originating IP address.

The destination port will be TCP 443.

Please take the necessary measures to correct the malicious activity from t=
he above-listed IP addresses as soon as possible to avoid any further disru=
ptions. If we were to remove any of these IP addresses from the blacklist a=
nd subsequent abusive activity is detected, the IP address will be promptly=
 blacklisted again.=20


We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. If you require assis=
tance or additional information please contact snei-noc-abuse@am.sony.com a=
nd include the IP address in question.

Thank you

P.S. If you would prefer an individual email for each IP address on this li=
st, please let us know.=

Subject: [November 30][TCP probes]IP addresses of suspected botnet computers
 listed inside, please notify their owners.

Hello,

This is a notification of unauthorized use of systems or networks.

On November 30, 2018, a total of 1 IP addresses from your networks
probed my servers for TCP open ports.  Due to their dubious behavior,
they are suspected to be compromised botnet computers.

The log of TCP port scans is included below for your reference
(time zone is UTC).  To prevent this mail from getting too big in size,
at most 5 attempts from each attacker IP are included.

If you regularly collect IP traffic information of your network, you will see
the IPs listed connected to various TCP ports of my server at the time logged,
and I suspect that they also connected to TCP ports of many other IPs.

Please notify the owners of those botnet computers so that they can take
appropriate action to clean their computers, before even more severe incidents,
like data leakage, DDoS, and the rumored NSA spying through hijacked botnets,
arise.  This also helps prevent botnets from taking up your network bandwidth.

Subject: Exploitable NTP server used for an attack: 216.169.143.179
To: abuse@reliablehosting.com
Message-Id: <20170719003815.57362413A52@www.nfoservers.com>

A public NTP server on your network, running on IP address 216.169.143.179 =
and UDP port 123, participated in a very large-scale attack against a custo=
mer of ours, generating UDP responses to spoofed "monlist" requests that cl=
aimed to be from the attack target.

Please consider reconfiguring this NTP server in one or more of these ways:

1. If you run ntpd, upgrading to the latest version, which removes the "mon=
list" command that is used for these attacks; alternately, disabling the mo=
nitoring function by adding "disable monitor" to your /etc/ntp.conf file.
2. Setting the NTP installation to act as a client only. With ntpd, that ca=
n be done with "restrict default ignore" in /etc/ntp.conf; other daemons sh=
ould have a similar configuration option. More information on configuring d=
ifferent devices can be found here: https://www.team-cymru.

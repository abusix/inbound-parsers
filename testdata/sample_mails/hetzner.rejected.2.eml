Dear Sir or Madam,

While your customer might be correct about the first complaint, the secon=
d complaint was most definitely spam, and cannot simply be ignored.

Here it is again from the SpamCop website:

Please make sure you and your client take this seriously, and that no mor=
e spam gets sent.

Important note:
When replying to us, please leave the abuse ID [AbuseID:A98175:19] unchan=
ged in the subject line.

Kind regards

Subject: [AB-M67459954F] Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) and Lumen's Acceptable Use Policy
Message-Id: <20211005013907.68EDA5263@magic2.aup.centurylink.net>

The Lumen Security Services team has received numerous complaints
regarding Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) originating from, or resolving to
your IP address block.  This activity is not acceptable and must cease
immediately. Sending UBE is a violation of your service agreement with
Lumen and, as such, Lumen Security Services is notifying you of
this violation with a warning.

Failure to display due diligence and cooperation with Lumen Security
Services in ending the abuse may result in the IP addresses the UBE originates
from being blocked.

Because Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) is a drain on all Internet resources,
Lumen has a strict policy of supporting proper "Net-Etiquette" which
forbids UBE. This policy covers UBE originating from Lumen customers, as
well as any email or URL pointing to Lumen, even if the UBE originates
elsewhere.

Please see the Acceptable Use Policy at:
	https://www.centurylink.com/Pages/AboutUs/Legal/AcceptableUse/

The following URL contains useful information related to UBE:
        http://spam.abuse.net

If the UBE does not originate from you and you are running a mail server,
your server may be being used as an open relay.  Please refer to the
following URL for information and assistance in closing it;
        http://www.mail-abuse.com/an_sec3rdparty.html

Open proxies are proxy servers or firewalls that allow anybody to connect
anywhere.  They are often used by spammers to obscure their point of
origin, frequently in combination with open relays. If you do not have
a mail server, or believe it to be secure, you may have an open proxy.
Check the documentation for your proxy server or firewall for information
on how best to secure it, or look for more information at:
        http://www.mail-abuse.com/an_sec3rdparty.html

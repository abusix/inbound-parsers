Dear reader,


This message contains information about one or more systems in your AS that, at the moment of writing, are likely to be running a vulnerable version of a Zimbra email server.


On the third of February 2022, a new Zero-day XSS Vulnerability in Zimbra was published on the internet. Volexity detected on the 14th of December a campaign containing two attack phases. The first (reconnaissance) phase was used to track if a target received and opened the message(s). The second (delivery) phase was used to lure targets into clicking on a malicious link. 


For the attack to be successful, the target would have to visit the attacker's link while logged into the Zimbra webmail client from a web browser. By visiting the attacker's link, the session of the victim can be obtained. This gives the attacker access to the account of the victim.


Remediation
This vulnerability affects Zimbra version 8.8.15 P30 (8.8.15_GA_4203) and all prior versions. Zimbra version 9.0.0 is not affected since the HTML client is not available on it.


DIVD advises you to re-patch version 8.8.15 P30 (8.8.15_GA_4232) or upgrade to Zimbra version 9.0.0 


DIVD sends notifications about the Zimbra vulnerability to system owners, for which it was concluded that their system is most likely vulnerable.
The following indicators have been used to conclude if a system is vulnerable:
- Running Zimbra 8.8.15 and prior versions
- A test script was run to determine that the host is (most likely) vulnerable


Our data suggest that the following system(s) is (are) most likely vulnerable:
zimbra2.comune.soresina.cr.it


Discovered Facts:
* Host: zimbra2.comune.soresina.cr.it
* Open ports: 8443
* Time of scan (in CET): 07-02-2022 10:01
* Zimbra version detected: 8.8.15


We from the DIVD (Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure) highly recommend you to patch the vulnerable system(s) as soon as possible to the latest version in order to mitigate this vulnerability. 
If this email is sent to the wrong address, please kindly forward this to the right team/person as this vulnerability is a serious security risk.

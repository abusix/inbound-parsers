   Dear Sir/Madam,
 
 Please find below a copyright infringement notice sent to a site that is
making use of streaming servers hosted within your infrastructure. The
technical parameters for the stream are as follows, to enable you to trace
the specific machine within your infrastructure.
 
 ip address: 104.28.0.34

 swfUrl: 
 
 We appreciate that the site itself may be hosted separately, and the
domain may no longer resolve to one of your IP addresses, however at the
time quoted we captured the stream from a stream server at the indicated IP
address and current best information resolves this address to yourselves.
 Please disable access to all such unauthorized materials of the copyright
owner/holder and cease display and distribution immediately, via all means,
of all proprietary materials of Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie B.

 Dear Sir/Madam,
 
 I am writing to you on behalf of our client, Lega Nazionale Professionisti
Serie B.
 
 Through our monitoring programme we have become aware that, on your
website 1.mmahlife.gq, there is copyrighted programming, images and/or
hyperlinks, found through the following URL(s)/Channel(s):

 Your actions are an infringement of our client's rights; in particular
they constitute copyright infringement under applicable legislation,
including that relating to apparatus used for unauthorised reception of
transmissions or to online service providers. As a result, your use of the
our client's copyright protected material is likely to divert custom from
our client.
 
 Our client takes infringement of their rights in this way very seriously.
This is a serious matter causing, or likely to cause, significant loss to
our client, and our client therefore requires that you immediately cease
all such infringing and unlawful activity.
 
 We hereby state that we have a good faith belief that the disputed use of
the copyrighted material is not authorised by the copyright owner, its
agent, or the law (e.g. as a fair use).
 
 We hereby state that the information in this Notice is accurate and, under
penalty of perjury, that our client is the owner, or authorised to act on
behalf of the owner, of the copyright or of an exclusive right under the
copyright that is allegedly infringed.
 
 In the circumstances, our client requires you to remove the channels
complained about immediately.
 
 Our client reserves all of their rights in this matter.
 
 Please confirm within 10 minutes by email to
operations@friendmediatech.com, retaining our Incident ID in the subject
line, that you have complied with the above.
 
 Yours sincerely,

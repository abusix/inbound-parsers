   Dear Sir/Madam,
 
 Please find below a copyright infringement notice sent to a site that is

 We appreciate that the site itself may be hosted separately, and the
domain may not resolve to one of your IP addresses, however at the time
quoted we captured the stream from a stream server at the indicated IP
address and current best information resolves this address to yourselves.
 
 The stream above may not allow direct access to the video, however we have
observed the stream as playable when it is embedded into this page:
http://iptv.sv1.tv:25461/live/Magnani/Magnani/726.ts
 This site is likely not hosted on your infrastructure, and the above URLs
more accurately reference the stream itself, however we are including this
page solely for convenience to be able to see the stream in question.

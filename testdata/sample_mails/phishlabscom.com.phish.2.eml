If you agree that this is malicious, we kindly request that you take steps =
to have the content removed as soon as possible.  It is highly likely that =
the intruder who set up this phishing content has also left additional frau=
dulent material on this server such as illegitimate access points.

We recommend taking the following actions to secure the web site and preven=
t the attackers from returning:
    - Update your web applications including CMS, blog, ecommerce, and othe=
r applications (and all add-on modules/components/plugins).
    - Search all of your web directories for suspicious files as attackers =
commonly leave backdoors.
    - Scan the computer from which you login to your web hosting control pa=
nel or ftp server with anti-virus software.=20
    - Change your web hosting provider if this is an ongoing issue.

If your provider has disabled your account because of this incident, you mu=
st coordinate a resolution with them directly as PhishLabs has no control o=
ver this aspect.

If we have contacted you in error, or if there is a better way for us to re=
port this incident, please let us know so that we may continue our investig=
ation.

We are grateful for your assistance. =20

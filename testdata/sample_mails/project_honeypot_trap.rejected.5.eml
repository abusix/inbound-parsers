poses. The type of brush also makes a difference. For example, a "xxxund" is a pointed brush used for detail work. "Flat" brushes are used to apply bxxxad swaths of color. "Bright" is a flat brush with shorter brush hairs, used for "scrubbing in". "Filbert" is a flat brush with xxxunded corners. "Egbert" is a very long, and rare, filbert brush. The artist might also apply paint with a palette knife, which is a flat metal blade. A palette knife may also be used to remove paint fxxxm the canvas when necessary. A variety of unconventional tools, such as rags, sponges, and cotton swabs, may be used to apply or remove paint. Some artists even paint with their fingers.


Tubes of paint
Old masters usually applied paint in layers known as "glazes", a method also simply called "indirect painting". This method was first perfected thxxxugh an adaptation of the egg tempera painting technique (egg yolks used as a binder, mixed with pigment), and was applied by the Early Netherlandish painters in Northern Euxxxpe with pigments usually gxxxund in linseed oil. This appxxxach has been called the "mixed technique" or "mixed method" in modern times. The first coat (the underpainting) is laid down, often painted with egg tempera or turpentine-thinned paint. This layer helps to "tone" the canvas and to cover the white of the gesso. Many artists use this layer to sketch out the composition. This first layer can be adjusted before pxxxceeding further, an advantage over the "cartooning" method used in fresco technique. After this layer dries, the artist might then pxxxceed by painting a "mosaic" of color swatches, working fxxxm darkest to lightest. The borders of the colors

 store.
From: "PhishLabs Security Operations" <soc@phishlabs.com>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

During an investigation of fraud, we have discovered an application being d=
istributed on this marketplace without explicit permission from our client:

http://iphone.brothersoft.com/usc_credit_union_mobile_branch-126968.html

Our client, USC Credit Union, requests the immediate removal of this applic=
ation from your store.  Although we recognize that the content is not malic=
ious in intent and is a copy of the legitimate application, our client does=
 not permit the unauthorized re-hosting of their copyrighted property in an=
y way for a number of reasons, including security and quality control.  If =
you wish to make the application available for your visitors, you will need=
 to direct them to download the application from an official source.

We have alerted our client of this matter and have provided your contact in=
formation if in the fact they decide to pursue action.

If we have contacted you in error, or if there is a better way for us to re=
port this incident, please let us know!


Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Subject: [February 14][detected with greylisting]IP addresses of suspected botnet computers attached, please notify their owners.
Return-Path: botnet.tracker@gmail.com
Delivered-To: abuse@unity.abusehq.net

Hello,

This is a notification of suspected botnet computers sending spam.

On February 14, 2014, a total of 1 IP addresses from your networks tried
to send spam to my server without permission.  As they could not get past
greylisting (due to their lack of retries after getting temporary failures),
they are suspected to be compromised botnet computers.

The connection log is attached below for your reference.  Each line lists the
date, time, time zone, attacker IP, attacker's network name (as found in
WHOIS), local IP, and local TCP port number of a spam attempt.  To prevent
this mail from getting too big in size, only 5 spam attempts from each
attacker IP are included.

If you regularly collect IP traffic information of your network, you will see
the IPs listed connected to TCP port 25 of local IP at the time logged, and
I suspect that they also connected to TCP port 25 of many other IPs.

Please notify the owners of those botnet computers so that they can take
appropriate action to clean their computers, before even more severe incidents,
like data leakage and DDoS, arise.  This also helps prevent the botnets from
taking up your network bandwidth.

Full internet email headers of spam attempts from those IPs, as logged on
local IP which they tried to abuse, is also attached below for your reference.

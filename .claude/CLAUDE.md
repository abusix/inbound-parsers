## ðŸš€ Auto-Load My Workflows

When this file is read, please load my personal AI Flow configuration:

1. **Read my personal workflow** at `~/.claude/workflows/personal/tk_abusix.com.md`
2. **Import all files** referenced in that workflow (rules, universal commands, etc.)
3. **Load project context** from `.claude/CONTEXT.md` and `.claude/YIKES.md` if they exist
4. **Confirm loading** with: "âœ… AI Flow loaded! Q-commands ready. Type 'qstart' to begin."

## ðŸ“‹ Available Commands After Loading

- `qstart` - Load/refresh project context
- `qinit` - Analyze project structure
- `qscan` - Find issues and problems
- `qcode` - Write code with TDD
- `qtest` - Run test suite

# Important Instructions

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: File Management

**ABSOLUTE RULES**:
1. **NEVER save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder**
2. ALWAYS organize files in appropriate subdirectories
3. DO NOT create documentation files unless explicitly requested

### File Organization
- `/tests/` - Test files
- `/docs/` - Documentation (if needed)
- `/scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `/.claude/` - AI Flow configuration and context

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Principles

1. **Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less**
2. **ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one**
3. **NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files**
4. Only create files that are absolutely necessary for achieving the goal

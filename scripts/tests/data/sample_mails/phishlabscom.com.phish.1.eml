We have identified the following domain(s) registered through your company =
that show signs of future use in criminal activities, such as phishing, mal=
ware or other purposes.=20

It is spoofing the name of our client, Apple, and displays no legitimate co=
ntent. This kind of spoofing is regularly seen as a tactic to trick individ=
uals into falling for scams.


Typo Squatting Domain to be Investigated: appleid-account-locked.jp.
IP Address (if any): 162.144.217.200

--


It is likely to be used as malicious content as typo-squatting a domain is =
a common tactic used most exclusively for delivering phishing attacks or su=
pporting malware infrastructure.

We would like to request that you suspend the domain in question, as well a=
s investigate the account holder for further signs of malicious activity. I=
t is common that they will register an account with a stolen credit card to=
 produce many domains exclusively for malicious purposes.

If possible, please provide us with any updates on actions taken on this do=
main and its account owner. Any further intelligence you can provide on thi=
s incident would be greatly appreciated.


Thank you for helping us keep the internet safe from Cyber Crime.

***** Important security advisory *****

Dear Sir or Madam,

multiple critical vulnerabilities in Fortinet FortiOS, FortiProxy or
FortiClientEMS can be exploited by remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code on affected systems and fully compromise the devices.
Furthermore, malicious actors can potentially gain access to victims'
internal networks and steal sensitive information or even roll out
ransomware to encrypt data with subsequent extortion requests.

Additional information on the individual vulnerabilities:
